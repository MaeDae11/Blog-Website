# Blog-Website
DigitalCrafts Project: blog page modeled after Medium.com website


The design of this website focused on different aspects of flexbox. We used the blog site, Medium.com, as a general layout and deisnged our own website from there. 
The ball of orange fluff is my cat, Oliver. He's a typical cat. Lays around, knocks drinks (and anything else he can find) off counters, but I love him all the same!

In this design, I created two extra pages.
